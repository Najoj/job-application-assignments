Assignment 2

Rules and requirements:

- The program shall be written in C

- Readability and maintainability is important

- Don't worry about PID resuse (you can ignore it)



Assignment:

1) Collect all PIDs in the system.

2) Sleep for a period of time (let's say 60 seconds)

3) Print missing and new PIDs along with the name of associated processes.

Example (where the PID counter has wrapped):

    This is the process list before (PID - processname):

        1 - init

        2 - sshd

        4 - foo


        This is the process list after (PID - processname):

            1 - init

            3 - sshd

            4 - bar



            This should print something like

            gone: 2 - sshd

            new: 3 - sshd


(You can neglect that PID 4 has been reused.)
